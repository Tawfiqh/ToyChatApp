ToDo:
=====

1. ~~Put our development vue app into a new folder. That compiles into the dist folder, that we can serve~~

2. ~~From Vue. Have a button that requests an emoji from a node backend.~~

3. Write unit tests for helloWorld and emoji Endpoints.

4. Refactor endpoints into setup functions. e.g: `setupHelloWorldEndpoint();`

3. Move chat page into Vue.

3. Login page - You enter a login ID and then youâ€™re in the chat room and it posts messages with your name.

4. Type the name of the chat-room you want to join and then it only gives you messages from that room.

6. Separate dependencies into dev-dependencies and dependencies.


Bonus:
Save login and chat history to database.
