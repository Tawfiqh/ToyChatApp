ToDo:
=====

~~ 1.Put our development vue app into a new folder. That compiles into the dist folder, that we can serve ~~

2. From Vue. Have a button that requests an emoji from a node backend.

3. Login page - You enter a login ID and then youâ€™re in the chat room.

4. I want there to be one chat room.

5. Serve a nice front-end in vue. Real time.

6. Separate dependencies into dev-dependencies and dependencies.


Bonus:
Multiple chat rooms.
Save login and chat history.
